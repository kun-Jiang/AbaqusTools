# [AbaqusTools](https://github.com/kun-Jiang/AbaqusTools)
A simple software GUI interface integrated with several python scripts for processing Abaqus input files.

# Manual
1. Double click the 'AbaqusTools_Run.bat' to open the GUI interface.
2. Just as the name of the widgets, the function of all tabwidgets are obvious. I won't explain them one by one except the **Offset** tabwidget.
+ The function of **Offset** script is for generating offseted element set for ABAQUS input file. It is noticed that there are two kinds of element set file which generated by **InpSplit** script or you prepared
    + The first kind of element set file contains element numbers and node numbers. So we just need to offset the element numbers but not the node numbers. The offset result is like this (Offset magnitude is 10000):
        > ***1***, 1, 2, 4, 3 --> ***10001***, 1, 2, 4, 3


        > **In order to identify this kind of element set file, The file name must be prefixed with *'Element'* and split with underscore. i.e. *Element_example.inp***
    + The second kind of element set file just contains element numbers. So every number will be offseted. The offset result is like this (Offset magnitude is 10000):
        > ***1***, ***2***, ***3***, ***4*** --> ***10001***, ***10002***, ***10003***, ***10004***

3. This script will generate four files which represent preset four layers element. The layer name will be added to the end of the file name. i.e. *Element_example_Mech.inp*. The real offset magnitude is the product of the ***Offset magnitude*** and ***Multiplier***. For example, the real offset magnitude of preset *Phase* layer is 10000*2=20000, so the offset result is like this:
    > ***1***, ***2***, ***3***, ***4*** --> ***20001***, ***20002***, ***20003***, ***20004***
